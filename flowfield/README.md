# Simulation

A particle simulation over a vector-field.

## To-do

[ok] Make particles initially with random velocities, and add a "follow button".

Use bilinear interpolation to get the velocity vectors, instead of just using the current grid cell vector (nearest-neighbor).

Add interactivity: change vectors directions when user drags the mouse over the field

Better streamline placement

Constraints on edge vectors?
